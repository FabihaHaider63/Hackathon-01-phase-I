# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation with Docusaurus Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-Assisted Content Generation
AI-assisted content generation using Claude Code MUST be leveraged throughout the book creation process to enhance productivity and quality.

### Structured, Modular Design
Books MUST follow a structured, modular design with Docusaurus, ensuring each component serves a clear purpose and can be maintained independently.

### Content Accuracy and Verification
All content MUST be accurate, verified, and up-to-date; examples and code snippets SHOULD be functional and tested before inclusion.

### Consistency and Clarity
Content MUST maintain consistency and clarity in technical explanations, with writing at an appropriate Flesch-Kincaid grade level (10-12) for accessibility.

### Reproducibility
Code examples and workflows MUST be reproducible, with all necessary dependencies and instructions clearly documented.

### Spec-Kit Plus Alignment
All work MUST align with Spec-Kit Plus specifications to ensure consistency with project standards and best practices.

## Standards and Constraints

Content must be accurate, verified, and up-to-date. Examples and code snippets should be functional and tested. Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12. Citations for any referenced materials. Docusaurus structure must include sidebar and metadata correctly. Word count: flexible, depending on chapters (approx. 5,000-10,000 words). Format: Docusaurus Markdown (.md) files. Deployment: GitHub Pages. No duplicate content; maintain uniqueness across chapters.

## Development Workflow

Success criteria include: Book fully deployable on GitHub Pages, all sections correctly formatted and linked in Docusaurus sidebar, code examples run without errors, content clear, concise, and traceable, and passing internal review for technical accuracy and readability.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation project. All development activities must comply with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require formal review and approval. Versioning follows semantic versioning practices, with MAJOR version increments for fundamental changes to project direction or principles.
