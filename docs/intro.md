# Introduction to the AI-Driven Book on ROS 2

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) for humanoid robotics. This book is designed to bridge the gap between digital AI and physical AI, teaching you how to create intelligent, embodied systems.

## What You'll Learn

This book is structured into modules that build upon each other, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to advanced topics:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, and services
- How to integrate Python AI agents with ROS controllers
- URDF for humanoid robot modeling
- Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors

## Target Audience

This book is aimed at:
- Developers interested in robotics and AI
- AI enthusiasts wanting to understand physical AI applications
- Students and learners using AI-powered textbooks

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Familiarity with basic Linux command line operations

## How to Use This Book

Each module is designed to be self-contained but builds on previous concepts. We recommend following the modules in order, but you can jump to specific topics as needed. Each chapter includes practical examples and code snippets that you can run and experiment with.

## Color Scheme

Throughout this book, we use a consistent color scheme:
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Text: Black (#000000)
- Accents: #80303F

This ensures readability and a consistent visual experience.

Let's begin with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).
