# Contracts: Book UI Frontend

## Overview
This feature is a frontend UI component for displaying book information. Since it's a static content display with no backend API requirements, there are no API contracts defined in this directory.

## Data Interface
The component accepts data through props as defined in the data model:

- Book information (title, subtitle, summary, etc.)
- Author information (name, role, bio, etc.)
- Footer links (portfolio, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, email)

See `data-model.md` for detailed data structure definitions.
